# Dual-button doorbell

Project is under construction. Errors are very lightly to occur at this stage. Custom symbols, footprints and 3D models can be found in [espena/kicad-libs](https://github.com/espena/kicad-libs) whenever they're ready.

A door bell that simply does more. Configurable with alarms, different sounds for the two buttons, bedtime LED indicator and timed notifications on specific days / hours. With audible 4Î© loudspeaker driven by a class D 3.2 W amplifier.

- SD card support for storing audio files and configuration
- WiFi interface for push notifications and remote configuration
- NTP corrected Real time clock for alarms and bedtime signal
- Volume reduction during bedtime
- Relay interface for triggering external equipment
